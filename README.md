## Activating the virtual environment
From the root directory activate the virtual environment as is appropriate for your OS: 
### POSIX
* bash/zsh - `source venv/Scripts/activate`
### Windows
* cmd.exe - `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
* PowerShell - `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
## Running tests
With the virtual environment active `python -m unittest discover -s tests` will run the unit tests.
## Running the app
With the virtual environment active `python app.py` will run the application.

To quit, use your OS's typical keyboard interrupt (`ctrl + c` on Windows) and press enter.
